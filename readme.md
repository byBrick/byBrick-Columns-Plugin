## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does this work?

This plugin enables you to use short codes right in the TinyMCE editor when writing a post and/or page.

For example: If you'd like to divide your content into two columns you would type: 

[one_half] This is the left column [/one_half] [one_half_last] This is the right collumn [/one_half_last]

Remember to "close" your short code, just as you would with HTML. Also; did you see the '_last' add there? That's REALLY important as it will remove the margin on the right side. If you forget it, your columns won't work.

#### How about another example?

[two_third] This area is two thirds wide [/two_third] [one_third_last] This is some more content [/one_third_last]

You can combine the available sizes any how you'd like, just as long as the math adds up. 

#### How do I know these columns width will fit my theme? =

All width is percentage based, so you should be safe!

## Changelog

### 1.4
* Fixed a headers already sent error.
* Columns now stack the way they are supposed to when screen width is smaller than 767px.
* This plugin now fixes that empty <p></p> tag that TinyMCE sometimes adds.

### 1.3
* This plugin now features a button that hooks right onto your TinyMCE editor. Click the button, enter the desired number of columns and voil√°! No need to enter the shortcodes by hand ever again (if you wish to use something, for example, like [four_fifth] you'll still need to enter those by hand). Oh; and the CSS file is now minified.

### 1.2
* Fixed a bug with [one_fourth] columns not working. Thanks jmd4eva for noticing.

### 1.1
* Added support for responsive wed design. Meaning; any columns you've created will wrap below each other and be 100% width if the screen width is a minimum of 480px (standard iPhone in landscape mode).

### 1.0
* Launch baby, launch!
